/\ This a ugly "Capivara dos Brother Universitária". I'm sorry it's so ugly.

A bird is not a bread just because it starts with "b". x

Minho is not a person, he's nothing at all.
If he was a person, tho, he would code and all this stuff.
This Hub is basicaly a mythological place where transdimensional codes, written by Minho, gather themselves to be appreciated.

Enjoy :)
